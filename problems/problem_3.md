## I want to refactor a legacy system. You want to rewrite it from scratch. Argument. Then, switch our roles.

### Argument in favour of rewrite code from scratch:

Rather than refactoring piece of code for the legacy system we can rewrite the whole code from the scratch that would give us an advantage that we have idea to build the ideal system as per the requirments.

### Argument in favour of refactor:

Every time or for every issue we can't rewrite the whole code from the scratch. Because its take lot of time and effort and to rewrite the code from start. So it would be better for us to refactor old code and add the particular feature or fix that issue.
